# bst-solver

A simple website that "solves" a binary search tree by outputting the inorder, preorder, and postorder traversals.

In the text field, input the BST elements, separated by a space. The elements are then added in the specified order it was inputted in to an empty binary search tree. Press the solve button to see the different BST traversals.
